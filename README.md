# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ArrietaUnai! 

I'm a physicist specialized in mathematical modelling. In recent years, I have been developing my career on software engineering.
I'm trying to learn what makes a good quality software product and always improving my skills.

Regarding my experience and skills, I mainly worked on C++, C, Python and Go.
Currently focused on learning the backend web stack and design patterns.

I have mainly worked in Computer Vision related projects, developing products centered on AI and Deep Learning.

In my spare time I love to check the latest technology news and make DIY projects.

Also, I love to hike, nature and hanging out with my friends.

Happy coding!
